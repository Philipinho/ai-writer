            <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3" id="5-fees-payment-and-renewal">5. Fees, Payment, and Renewal</h2>

            <h3 id="a-CopyPhrase-fees">a. CopyPhrase Fees</h3>
            <p><strong>Fees for Paid Services.</strong> Some of our Services are offered for a fee, such as CopyPhrase premium plans and addons. By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees (for example, <a href="https://copyphrase.com#pricing/">CopyPhrase fees</a>, and fees associated with specific features. Depending on the Paid Service, there may be a one-time fee, recurring fees or usage-based fee. For recurring fees, we’ll bill or charge you for in regular automatically-renewing intervals (such as monthly, annually, or biennially), on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time on your dashboard or by contacting the relevant support team. For usage-based fees -- such as fees for credits/words -- you pay us a fee based on actual usage on a post-pay basis. Usage-based fees are ongoing.</p>
            <p><strong>Taxes.</strong> To the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fees are exclusive of applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges now in force or enacted in the future (“Taxes”). You are responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes relating to your use of our Services, your payments, or your purchases. If we are obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the Fees you’ve paid or will pay, you are responsible for such Taxes, and we may collect payment for such Taxes.</p>
            <p><strong>Payment.</strong> If your payment fails or if Paid Services are otherwise not paid for or paid for on time, we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to the Paid Services. If you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services, we may revoke your access to our Services in general.</p>
            <p><strong>Automatic Renewal.</strong> To ensure uninterrupted service, recurring Paid Services are automatically renewed. This means that unless you cancel a Paid Service before the end of the applicable subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to invoice you or use any payment mechanism we have on record for you to collect the then-applicable subscription fee (as well as any Taxes). By default, your Paid Services will be renewed for the same interval of time as your original subscription period. For example, if you purchase a CopyPhrase annual plan, you will be charged each year for the following 12-month period. We may charge your account up to one month before the end of the subscription period. It is your responsibility to make sure you are checking your email (including any spam or other filters) in order to receive any reminder email we send to you in advance of renewal. The date for the automatic renewal is determined automatically based on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed. You can view your renewal date by visiting your <a href="https://copyphrase.com/dashboard">Web Dashboard</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Cancelling Automatic Renewal.</strong> You can manage and cancel your Paid Services at the respective Service’s site. For example, you can manage all of your CopyPhrase plans through your CopyPhrase <a href="https://copyphrase.com/dashboard">Web Dashboard</a>. To cancel a CopyPhrase plan, go to the Billing tab,"Click on Manage Subscription" then follow the instructions to “cancel the subscription.” You must repeat this process for each Team subscription you wish to cancel.</p>
            <p><strong>Fee Changes.</strong> We may change our fees at any time, or start charging fees for Services that were previously free. When applicable, we may give you advance notice of the fee changes. If you don’t agree with the fee changes, you must cancel your Paid Service.</p>
            <p><strong>Refunds.</strong> While you may cancel a Paid Service at any time, refunds are issued in our sole discretion, unless otherwise required by applicable law.
                <br>All refund requests must be made in writing to support@copyphrase.com and we reserve the right to deny such request for any concrete reason.
                <br>Our payment processor will make the reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than 14 days after the day on which your refund request was approved.
            </p>

            <h3 id="b-fees-collected-by-website-owners">b. Fees Collected by Website Owners</h3>
            <p><strong>Fees Paid to Websites or Website Owners.</strong> Website owners may choose to sell items (goods, content, services, etc.), offer subscriptions for their websites at specific price points and intervals, or simply collect payments. Please note that we are not involved in a website's subscription details, or a website's store operations (including the quality, timing, pricing, or legality of what may or may not be included in exchange for payment, or any goods or services purchased). If you purchase items or subscriptions from a website, your purchase is directly from the website owner, who is solely responsible for the items sold. Please contact the website owner if you have any questions or complaints.</p>
            <p><strong>Refunds.</strong> We are not responsible for refunds for fees paid to a website owner because those transactions are between website owners and their users. If you would like to request a refund for any fees paid to a website or website owner, please contact the website owner. If you have a complaint regarding a website owner, you can <a href="https://copyphrase.com/contact">contact us</a>.</p>

            <h3 id="a-CopyPhrase-com-websites-and-accounts">a. CopyPhrase Accounts</h3>

            <p><a href="https://copyphrase.com/">CopyPhrase</a> enables you to generate high-quality and creative content using artificial intelligence, and we would love for you to use it. Creating a CopyPhrase account also allows you to access some of our other Services.

            </p>
            <p><strong>Prohibited Uses.</strong> By using CopyPhrase, you represent and warrant that your Content and conduct do not violate this Terms of Service. </p>

            <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3" id="8-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy">8. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy</h2>
            <p>As we ask others to respect our intellectual property rights, we respect the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that material located on or associated with an CopyPhrase product or service violates your copyright, please notify us through our <a href="https://copyphrase.com/contact">Abuse page</a>. We will respond to such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. We will terminate a visitor’s access to and use of the website if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of CopyPhrase or others. In the case of such termination, we will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to us.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3" id="9-intellectual-property">9. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>The Agreement does not transfer from CopyPhrase to you any CopyPhrase or third party intellectual property, and all right, title, and interest in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with CopyPhrase. CopyPhrase, the CopyPhrase logo, and all other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with CopyPhrase or our Services, are trademarks or registered trademarks of CopyPhrase or CopyPhrase’s licensors. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with our Services may be the trademarks of other third parties. Your use of our Services grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any CopyPhrase or third party trademarks.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3" id="10-third-party-services">10. Third Party Services</h2>
            <p>In using the Services, you may enable or use services, products, software, embeds, or applications developed by a third party (“Third Party Services”) as made available on your account by us. If you use any Third Party Services, you understand that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Any use of a Third Party Service is at your own risk, and we shall not be responsible or liable to anyone for Third Party Services.</li>
                <li>Your use is solely between you and the respective third party (“Third Party”) and will be governed by the Third Party’s terms and policies. It is your responsibility to review the Third Party’s terms and policies before using a Third Party Service.</li>
                <li>Some Third Party Services may request or require access to your (yours, your visitors’, or customers’) data, for example, via a pixel or cookie. If you use the Third Party Service or grant access, your data will be handled in accordance with the Third Party’s privacy policy and practices. We do not have control over how a Third Party Service may use your data. You should carefully review Third Party Services’ data collection, retention, and use policies and practices before enabling Third Party Services.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In rare cases, we may at our discretion, suspend, disable, or remove Third Party Services from your account or website.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3" id="11-changes">11. Changes</h2>
            <p>We are constantly updating our Services and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our Services are offered. These Terms may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of CopyPhrase, or by the posting by CopyPhrase of a revised version. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by posting on one of our blogs, or by sending you an email or other communication before the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using our Services within the designated notice period, or once the changes become effective. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3" id="12-termination">12. Termination</h2>
            <p>We may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. We have the right (though not the obligation) to, in our sole discretion, (i) reclaim your username or website’s URL due to prolonged inactivity, (ii) refuse or remove any content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any CopyPhrase policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, (iii) ask you to make some adjustments, restrict the resources your website uses, or terminate your Services, if we believe your website’s storage or bandwidth usage is out of hand and/or burdens our systems (which is rare and typically only occurs when a website is used for file sharing or storage), or (iv) terminate or deny access to and use of any of our Services to any individual or entity for any reason. We will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.</p>
            <p>If you wish to terminate the Agreement or your CopyPhrase account, you may simply discontinue using our Services, or, if you are using a paid service, you may cancel at any time, subject to the Fees, Payment, and Renewal section in these Terms. </p>
            <p>All provisions of the Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce the Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3" id="16-limitation-of-liability">16. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>In no event will CopyPhrase, or its suppliers or licensors, be liable with respect to any subject matter of the Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (i) any special, incidental or consequential damages; (ii) the cost of procurement for substitute products or services; (iii) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data; or (iv) for any amounts that exceed $50 or the fees paid by you to CopyPhrase under the Agreement during the twelve (12) month period prior to the cause of action, whichever is greater. CopyPhrase shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond their reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3" id="17-indemnification">17. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless CopyPhrase, its contractors, and its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all losses, liabilities, demands, damages, costs, claims, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of or related to your use of our Services, including but not limited to your violation of the Agreement, Content that you post, and any ecommerce activities conducted through your or another user’s website.</p>

            <p>You expressly represent and warrant that your use of our Services and/or associated services and products is not contrary to applicable UK Sanctions or U.S. Sanctions or European Union Sanctions.

            <p>These Terms were originally written in English. We may translate these terms into other languages. In the event of a conflict between a translated version of these Terms and the English version, the English version will control.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3" id="20-miscellaneous">20. Miscellaneous</h2>
            <p>The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between CopyPhrase and you concerning the subject matter hereof. If any part of the Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of the Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your rights under the Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; CopyPhrase may assign its rights under the Agreement without condition. The Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns. </p>
