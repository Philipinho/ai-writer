            <p>The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational
                procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases,
                the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of this
                Application (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies)

            <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Legal basis of processing</h4>

                applies:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the
                Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing ('optout'), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does
                not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to United Kingdom data protection law;</li>
            <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any
                pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>

            <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;
                processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
                authority vested in the Owner;</li>

                third party.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and
                in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a
                requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p><h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Place</h4>
            <p> The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the parties
                involved in the processing are located.</p>

            <p>
                Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a country other
                than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can check
                the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.

                or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more
                countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.
                If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Retention time</h4>
            <p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they

                Owner.</li>
            </ul>


            <p>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given
                consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be
                obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a
                legal obligation or upon order of an authority.
            </p>
            <p>
